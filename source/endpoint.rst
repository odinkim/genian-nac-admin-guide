Controlling Endpoints with Agent
--------------------------------

.. note:: This feature required Professional or Enterprise Edition

An Endpoint device is an Internet-capable computer hardware device on a TCP/IP network. 
This can be anything from desktop computers, laptops, smartphones, tablets, thin clients, 
printers or other specialized hardware.

You can control Windows and macOS endpoint devices with the Genian NAC Agent. When installed onto the endpoint, it
then runs in the background and communicates with the Policy Server when changes to the endpoint are made. The Agent
takes action with policies to manage the endpoint system information, such as the operating system, updates, applications,
registry entries, and services, that aids you in detecting and dealing with anomalies on the endpoint.
